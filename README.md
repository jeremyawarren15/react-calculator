This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The Purpose of this Project
I have other projects that I would like to write in React, but I want to come into those projects with a little bit more experience. I made this project mostly for that reason, but I also wanted to work on a prject that wasn't the typical CRUD application.

## Future Plans
I want to keep adding/refactoring this project in the future. I would like to add more operators and a calculation history.

## Running the project locally

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
